## üîç How It‚Äôs Different from Taking Normal Screenshots

1. **Unorganized Storage**: Normally, screenshots are saved in a general folder, making it difficult to find the specific one you need later. This extension organizes your screenshots into chapters based on the video or website.
2. **No Context**: Traditional screenshots don‚Äôt allow you to add comments or labels to explain their purpose. With this extension, you can add personalized comments or titles, making your notes meaningful and easier to understand.
3. **Problem-Solving Tool**: This extension solves these issues by:
   - Organizing screenshots by video or website into chapters for quick access.
   - Allowing users to add comments, labels, or titles to screenshots for better context.
   - Supporting edits to labels or titles anytime.
4. **Enhanced Flexibility**:
   - Easily delete an entire chapter or individual screenshots.
   - Use the **Redirect to Timestamp** feature to resume a YouTube video at the exact moment a screenshot was taken.
   - Provides a better reading and navigation experience.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

1. While reading through a website or watching a video (e.g., YouTube), take screenshots directly using the extension.
2. Screenshots are stored in Chrome's local database and can be exported if needed.
3. Access your saved chapters and screenshots by clicking the extension icon. Chapters are automatically organized by video or website titles.
